# How to download and use webparser.dll for Rainmeter 28
 
Rainmeter is a popular desktop customization tool that allows you to display various information on your screen, such as weather, news, system stats, RSS feeds and more. To get some of this information from the web, Rainmeter uses a measure called WebParser, which can read and parse HTML output from any web page or local file.

WebParser was previously a plugin measure, which means you had to download and install a separate file called webparser.dll to use it. However, since Rainmeter 28, WebParser is no longer a plugin, but a built-in measure that does not require any additional files. This means you can use WebParser without downloading anything extra.
 
If you have an older version of Rainmeter that still uses webparser.dll, you can download it from [the official documentation page](https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/measures/webparser/). However, it is recommended that you update your Rainmeter to the latest version to enjoy the new features and improvements.
 
To use WebParser in your skin, you need to create a parent measure that specifies the URL of the web page or file you want to read, and a regular expression that extracts the information you want. Then you create one or more child measures that refer to the parent measure and use StringIndex values to access the extracted information. You can then use these child measures in your meters to display the information on your screen.
 
For example, if you want to get the current temperature and humidity from [weather.com](https://weather.com/), you can use the following code:

    [MeasureParent]
    Measure=WebParser
    URL=https://weather.com/weather/today/l/47.07,15.44
    RegExp=(?siU)Temperature.*?°(.*)<.*?Humidity.*?>(.*)<
    
    [MeasureTemp]
    Measure=WebParser
    URL=[MeasureParent]
    StringIndex=1
    
    [MeasureHumid]
    Measure=WebParser
    URL=[MeasureParent]
    StringIndex=2
    
    [MeterTemp]
    Meter=String
    MeasureName=MeasureTemp
    Text="Temperature: %1Â°C"
    
    [MeterHumid]
    Meter=String
    MeasureName=MeasureHumid
    Text="Humidity: %1%"

For more information and examples on how to use WebParser, you can check out [the WebParser tutorial](https://docs.rainmeter.net/tips/webparser-tutorial/) and [the RSS/Atom feed tutorial](https://docs.rainmeter.net/tips/rss-atom-feed-tutorial/) on the official documentation site.
  
WebParser is a powerful and versatile measure that can help you create dynamic and interactive skins for your desktop. However, it also has some limitations and challenges that you should be aware of. Here are some tips and tricks to make the most out of WebParser:
 
- WebParser cannot use cookies or other session-based authentication, so it cannot access web pages that require a login. However, it can use HTTP authentication if the web page supports it. For example, you can use `URL=https://username:password@somesite.com` to access a protected page.
- WebParser can read and parse local files on your computer by using the `file://` URI scheme. For example, you can use `URL=file://#CURRENTPATH#SomeFile.txt` to read a text file in the same folder as your skin. Note that you must use a fully qualified path to the file.
- If you want to use the current value of a measure in a dynamic way as a section variable, you must prefix the name of the measure with the `&` character. For example, you can use `URL=https://somesite.com/[&WebMeasure]` to use the value of WebMeasure as part of the URL.
- WebParser will automatically URL-encode any characters after the protocol://host/path/ portion of the URL that are not URL-safe or URL-delimiter characters. This means that spaces and other special characters will be converted to percent-encoded values. For example, `URL=https://somesite.com?search=I live in MÃ¼nchen` will be sent as `URL=https://somesite.com?search=I%20live%20in%20M%C3%BCnchen`.
- If you want to debug your WebParser code, you can use the Debug option to save the downloaded web page or file to a text file in your skin folder. For example, you can use `Debug=2` to save the output to WebParserDump.txt. This can help you see what WebParser is actually reading and parsing. Remember to remove this option once you have your code working correctly.
