It works by replacing the original activation files with modified ones that bypass the verification process. This way, you can enjoy the full features and updates of your products without any restrictions.  However, using KMSpico also comes with some risks and disadvantages. First of all, it is illegal to use KMSpico or any other similar tool to activate products that you do not own or have a license for.
