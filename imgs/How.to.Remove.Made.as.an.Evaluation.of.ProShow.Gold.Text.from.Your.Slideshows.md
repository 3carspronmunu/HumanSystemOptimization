ProShow Gold is a software that allows you to create professional-looking slideshows with photos, videos, music and effects. However, if you are using the trial version of the software, you will see a text that says "Made as an evaluation of ProShow Gold" on your slideshows. This text is a watermark that indicates that you have not purchased the full version of the software.

2. Use a video editing software such as Camtasia 9 to crop or cover the text on your slideshows.
