One of the best solutions available on the market today is VMProtect Ultimate 3.4.0 Build 1155 Retail, a powerful and versatile software protection tool that uses virtualization and mutation techniques to make your code extremely difficult to analyze and crack. In this article, we will show you how VMProtect Ultimate works and how you can use it to protect your software with minimal efforts.
 
## What is VMProtect Ultimate 3.4.0 Build 1155 Retail?
 
VMProtect Ultimate 3.4.0 Build 1155 Retail is the latest version of VMProtect, a brand of Code Defender, a leading developer of anti-piracy and anti-theft software products. VMProtect protects code by executing it on a virtual machine with non-standard architecture that makes it extremely difficult to analyze and crack the software.
 
VMProtect Ultimate has all the features you have come to expect from Code Defender products, such as serial number generation and verification, licensing feature, user interface modes, and support for common languages and operating systems. But what makes VMProtect Ultimate stand out from other software protection tools is its unique core technology: the use of virtualization.
 
## How does virtualization work?
 
Virtualization is the process of translating executable code into instructions of a virtual machine with a different architecture, that is unknown to a potential cracker. Virtualized parts of the code are executed by the interpreter (virtual machine) without being converted into native machine code.
 
This means that a cracker who wants to reverse engineer or modify your code has to first understand the architecture of the virtual machine, which is not a standard one and changes every time you protect your software. Then, he has to create a disassembler that can understand that architecture and translate it back into human-readable code. Both processes are very time-consuming and require advanced skills and tools.
 
VMProtect Ultimate also uses mutation techniques to further obfuscate your code and hide the signatures of third-party libraries used in your software. Mutation is a process of replacing the source code instructions with their analogs or sequences that give the same result as the source code. This makes it harder for a cracker to recognize familiar patterns or algorithms in your code.
 
## How to use VMProtect Ultimate 3.4.0 Build 1155 Retail?
 
Using VMProtect Ultimate 3.4.0 Build 1155 Retail is very easy and does not require any special knowledge or skills. You can choose between two modes of user interface: simple and expert.
 
In simple mode, you can easily select functions for protection, adjust options, and get the protected file with just a few mouse clicks. In expert mode, you can customize every aspect of protection, such as encryption keys, virtual machine parameters, mutation settings, etc.
 
You can also add serial numbers to your protected software with minimal efforts using VMProtect's robust API that allows you to pass a serial number to VMProtect's internal module and then check its state. You can also use the licensing feature to limit the period of free updates, set the time of life of serial number, prevent the code execution without serial numbers, and more.
 
VMProtect Ultimate supports common languages such as Visual Basic, Visual C++, C#, Delphi, and C/C++, as well as numerous operating systems such as Win32, Linux, Mac OS X, and Open-VMS.
